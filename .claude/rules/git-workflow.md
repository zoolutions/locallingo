# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes

Format:
```
feat(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed. Focus on WHY, not WHAT.

Refs #123
```

## Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/description` - Refactoring
- `ci/description` - CI changes
- `chore/description` - Maintenance

## PR Workflow

1. Create branch from `main`
2. Make focused, atomic commits
3. Run all validators before pushing
4. Create PR with description and test plan
5. Request review
6. Squash merge when approved

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Run before EVERY commit:
```bash
bundle exec rake rubocop            # Style
bundle exec rspec <relevant_specs>  # Tests
```

## Rules

- **NEVER** commit directly to `main`
- **NEVER** force push to shared branches
- **NEVER** touch `lib/locallingo/version.rb` in a PR — `rake release[x.y.z]` owns the version bump
- **ALWAYS** run validators before committing
- **ALWAYS** write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused
- One logical change per commit
